				<h2>Here we begin my personal blog of the past ten years of my culinary career.</h2>
<main>

<h4>Brief history</h4>
		<p>I began my career like most on the pot wash area being readily called dish pig for the better part of a year, 
		But as they say a little banter creates character!One of the cooks at the time was known for his drink, 
		and as such missed a shift or two that i readily picked up for the extra hours, a year into my new role i decided
		that i wanted more out this industry. Soon i had landed a placement in the local college studying for my N.V.Q 2
		in Professional cookery, sadly i wasn't to complete the course at this college as i had landed a new job somewhere 
		rather prestigious!</p>

		<p>With my new roll as commis chef at<strong><a href="https://www.wentworthclub.com/"target="_blank"> Wentworth Golf Club </a></strong>
		starting soon, i decided i better get packing! Soon enough it was my first day, nerves were hitting hard, most of the
		staff thought id drank to much coffee from how i was shaking. but soon nerves started to settle and the daunting task
		ahead started to settle in! This was not the type of kitchen i was used two, we had 6 cooks maximum, here that was a 
		different story! The sheer sight of 24 chefs running around at full pelt was amazing to behold and not to mention the
		almost silent kitchen porters chasing after the chefs to clean up. I spent a total of two years here training hard and 
		well what can i say partying!! I had learned the base skills i needed to survive in a kitchen so i began pondering if
		it was time to move on for a new challenge.</p>

		<strong><p><a href="https://www.thewollaton.co.uk/"target="_blank"> The Wollaton pub and kitchen </a></strong> now this is where things really started to get interesting!
		Unlike the previous kitchen where i was filled with nerves on my first day here i had a slightly cocky overtone to myself. I was soon to be put in my place,
		they had mistakenly mixed up interviews and thought i was trailing for the jnr sous chef position, where as i'd applied for the chef de partie vacancy.
		Either way i wasn't going down without a fight! Three hours into a busy lunch service on the sauce section (I had minimal exposure to this section 
		and even less experience) i was taken to the side and told i had the job i applied for, sadly not the one i trailed for, not yet anyway!
